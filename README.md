# Should the U.S. Ban TikTok?
In this document, I will discuss the issue of whether the United States should ban TikTok due to national security and data privacy concerns. TikTok is a popular social media app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. I will present and discuss two opposing views on this matter. 

## Article 1
In Amsterdam News' [Why the U.S. Needs to Ban TikTok?](https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/04/11/why-the-u-s-needs-to-ban-tiktok/), Armstrong Williams argues that the U.S. should ban the use of  TikTok due to national security concerns. He thinks that TikTok can collect user data and share it with the Chinese government. He is also concerned about its influence on young Americans' political beliefs, given its extensive user base. He suggests that banning TikTok would send a clear message to China, protecting American citizens and national security.

I think the national security concerns raised by Williams are reasonable, but I also think banning an app that millions of users rely on for entertainment and connection should be a cautious decision. Exploring international cooperation and regulations for apps with global audience might be a more suitable choice. 

## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in Amsterdam News, in The Conversation's [A TikTok ban isn’t a data security solution. It will be difficult to enforce – and could end up hurting users](https://theconversation.com/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-a-data-security-solution-it-will-be-difficult-to-enforce-and-could-end-up-hurting-users-202732), Milovan Savic opposes the idea of banning TikTok. She argues that banning TikTok risks alienating its predominantly young user base and fails to provide a comprehensive solution to data privacy and protection. She thinks that it's crucial to consider alternative approaches to address data security and privacy concerns that do not infringe on individual freedoms.

Savic also raises questions about the ban's legitimacy, difficulties with its implementation, and its effectiveness in resolving data security issues. Although banning TikTok can seem like a quick fix, it might not be able to address the underlying reasons of data security problems. Policymakers should explore more effective and systematic measures to protect user data across different social media platforms.
